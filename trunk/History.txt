			/DONT				Don't build library, only source files: only the ASM files and .Desc file will be created.
			/KEEP				Keep source files after making the library: the intermediate ASM files used to build the library will be copied to the 'Asm source files' folder below. By default, they are deleted.
			/LIBN:<Name>			Uses the supplied name instead of the sourcename
			/LOGF				A logfile is generated in the temp folder.	Hint : you can find it here : C:\Documents and settings\[Username]\Local settings\temp\TailBite_Logfile.txt

			/OUTP "Path"			The compiled library will be saved into the supplied path.
			/UCOD				The library will be UNICODE compiled
			/SUBS:<Subsystem>	Path to subsystem folder (starting from SubSystems). 
			/THRD				The library will be THREADSAFE compiled
			/WRIT				Generate build batch file: TailBite will generate a batch file in the library source folder to allow fast rebuilding which, anyway, you can do more easyly with TailBite itself (processing the .Desc file).
