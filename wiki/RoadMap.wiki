= Milestone 0.7 =
 * TO ADD : Management of Profile
  * ProgramParameter (in Tailbite)
   * /CHM Name of helpfile  : The name of the helpfile without extension .chm (supresses the inputrequester)
   * /DONT : Don't build library, only source files: only the ASM files and .Desc file will be created.

   * /SUBS Subsystem Path to subsystem folder (starting from SubSystems). 
   * /THRD : The library will be THREADSAFE compiled
   * /WRIT : Generate build batch file: TailBite will generate a batch file in the library source folder to allow fast rebuilding which, anyway, you can do more easyly with TailBite itself (processing the .Desc file).
